This file contains a description of the formatting and units within each configuration file. We
will provide a description of each separate configuration file in detail.

1) position.json: This configuration file contains the position of each sensor (designated by its
serial number). Each position is represented by a three dimensional vector in units of (blank).
A horizontal coordinate system is used as our basis to represent each vector. We separate the
vector into its conponents for convenience in the file.

2) characteristics.json: This configuration file contains the orientation, sensitivity, and noise
density vectors of each sensor designated by their serial number. We use the same horizontal
coordinate system as a basis to represent our vectors.  The vectors are again separated into
their components for convenience. The orientation units are in units of (blank), the sensitivity
is in units of milli-volts per gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth (mV/g),
and the noise density is in units of micro-volts per gravitational acceleration at the surface of
the earth (uV/g). g is taken to be 9.81 m/s^2.

3) response.json: This file contains the function we are convolving the accelerations with called
'linear_response' to get an output reading. For now we are convolving with a kronecker delta, but
this is subject to change. 'signal_transfer_response' contains all of the binning limits for the
accelerations. The accelerations are in units of inverse square meters (m^-2) as are the binning
limits. These accelerations are eventually transformed into integers to mimic a digitizer's
response to an accelerometer's measured acceleration. Once again this information is given for
each sensor indicated by its serial number.

***Note on adding sensors***: It is suggested that if you wish to add a sensor to copy the line
of an existing sensor and pasting it to the end of the json object list. From there change all
informaation that needs to be changed (most importantly the serial number). Do not forget to
change the sensor number at the beginning of the file if present. Verify that there are no
extra/unnecessary whitespace and/or newlines.
